**Time Between Earthquakes: Exponential distribution**

This project investigates the temporal patterns of earthquakes in Japan by analyzing inter-arrival times between seismic events. After removing aftershocks to ensure independence of events, it is possible to model the remaining earthquake occurrences using statistical distributions to understand their underlying patterns.

**Key Questions:**  

*Does the time between earthquakes follow an exponential distribution after removing aftershocks?*

*How frequently do independent earthquakes occur in Japan?*

*Do earthquakes of different magnitudes have different temporal patterns?*

**Methods**  
- *Exponential Distribution Modeling*: Fitted exponential distribution to inter-arrival times, estimated rate parameter (Î») and mean inter-arrival time, conducted Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to assess goodness-of-fit
- *Probability Calculations*
- *Histograms, PDF, Q-Q plot*
