**Crop Domestication Trait Analysis: Non-Parametric Comparison of Cultivated and Wild Wheat**

This project examines phenotypic differences between cultivated and wild wheat using trait-level data from the Crop Domestication Traits Database (CDTD). It applies non-parametric statistical methods to assess the extent and significance of domestication-related changes in key agronomic traits.

**Key Questions**:

*Which morphological and reproductive traits significantly differ between cultivated and wild wheat?*

*What is the direction and strength of trait shifts associated with domestication?*

*How large are the observed differences in practical terms (effect sizes)?*

**Methods**
- *Mann–Whitney U Test*: Used to compare trait distributions between cultivated and wild groups, without assuming normality.
- *Cliff’s Delta*: Calculated as a robust, non-parametric effect size metric to quantify the magnitude of group differences.
- *Visualization*: Boxplots and histograms were generated to illustrate group-wise trait distributions.
