**School Performance Analysis: Income-Adjusted Means**

This project investigates the relationship between family income and math performance across two schools (A and B), using statistical methods to control for socioeconomic confounding. 

**Key Questions:**  
*How much of School A's performance advantage persists after accounting for income disparities?*

*Do the schools serve significantly different income populations?*

**Methods**  
- *Adjusted Mean Comparison*: ANCOVA to isolate the school effect after controlling for income.  
- *Quantile Analysis*: Examined income distributions at the 25th, 50th (median), 75th, and 90th percentiles.  
- *Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test*: Tested for overall income distribution differences.  
- *ECDFs*: compare income and score distributions.
