**Battery Aging Patterns: Permutation testing**

**Objective**:
To statistically evaluate how different operational conditions affect the uniformity of lithium-ion battery degradation by comparing performance metric variances across:

- Temperature regimes (24°C vs. 43°C)

- Cycle life stages (early vs. late cycles)

- Key impedance parameters (Re and Rct)
