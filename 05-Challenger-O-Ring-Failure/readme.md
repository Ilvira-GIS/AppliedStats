**Statistical Analysis of the Challenger Disaster on January 28, 1986**

The Space Shuttle Challenger exploded 73 seconds after launch on January 28, 1986, killing all seven crew members. Subsequent investigation identified cold temperature-induced O-ring failure in the solid rocket boosters as the primary cause.

**Key Questions**:

- Did temperature affect O-ring failure probability?
  
  (Yes)
- How extreme were Challenger's launch conditions?

   (Far beyond operational limits)
- Were engineers' warnings statistically justified?

   (Absolutely)


**Methods**

- Simple and BCa Bootstrap confidence interval estimation
