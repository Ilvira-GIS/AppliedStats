A collection of real-world data analyses demonstrating **statistical methods** (ANCOVA, regression, hypothesis testing) with clear interpretations.

## Projects
1. **[School Performance Analysis](01-School-Performance-Analysis)**  
   Analyzes math score disparities between two schools, adjusting for family income.

2. **[Time Between Earthquakes](02-Time-Between-Earthquakes)**  
   Compute inter-arrival times (time between quakes above magnitude 5.5) to estimate risk probabilities.

3. **[Battery Degradation Consistency](03-Battery-Degradation-Consistency)**  
   Compare capacity degradation to determine if certain conditions (e.g., temperature, discharge rate) lead to more inconsistent battery performance.

4. **[Complaint Resolution Times](04-Complaint-Resolution-Times)**  
   Analyse how long it takes to resolve complaints for the major health insurance companies.
